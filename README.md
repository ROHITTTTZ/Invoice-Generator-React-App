## 📚 Lessons Learned
While building the Invoice Generator Website, I gained valuable insights and encountered challenges that enhanced my development skills:

- ⚙️ **Handling Dynamic Forms**: Managing dynamic form entries was tricky, especially when calculating tax and total amounts in real-time. I overcame this by using React state management effectively to track and update form fields.
  
- 📝 **Auto-Filling Features**: Implementing the auto-fill functionality for consignee details was challenging due to the complexity of managing stored data. I solved this by fetching suggestions from the database to populate consignee details. I used React's Context API to manage and flow data across components efficiently, ensuring the UI was updated seamlessly based on the user's input.

- 🎨 **UI Design for Invoices**: Designing an intuitive and professional invoice UI that would meet the company's requirements involved iterations and feedback. I used TailwindCSS for a flexible and responsive design, ensuring the UI was both functional and visually appealing.
